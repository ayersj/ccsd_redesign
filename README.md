A redesign of the website for Hamilton High School (Hamilton, IL)

I have been working with Free Code Camp for the past several months and recently completed the Front End Certification. At this stage in my learning, I am taking time to hone my front-end design skills by redesigning various websites. I am looking for a few things as I choose websites that I might want to redesign:

1) The site is in need of a new coat of paint (I could eventually help the owner provide this!)
2) The site is reasonably simple (I am a novice, after all!)
3) I would prefer to work on websites related to local organizations/businesses (more likely to want to work with me once I'm ready!)

Hamilton High School's website (http://www.hhs328.com) definitely ticks all of these boxes. It is in definite need of improvement - the site is outdated and very difficult for a user to follow. It does not seem that a lot of thought was put into the design of the site - various links are just thrown up all over the place. The site is also generally not very aesthetically pleasing. I believe that I could make a large improvement on the current situation with a relatively small amount of work. A school website does not need to be very complex. It needs to be designed in a way that allows users to intuitively gain access to the information that they need. I think that this is a reasonable starting point for me. Finally, I am a graduate of Hamilton High School so it would be really rewarding to eventually be able to impact the district in a positive way, even if it's fairly small.

As I planned my redesign of the site, I developed a few goals:
1) Make the design of the site intuitive - a user should be able to follow a logical and efficient path to the information that he/she seeks.
2) Limit the use of links on the home page - focus instead on creating a positive image of the district using photos and an introduction from the district superintendent
3) Make the website more aesthetically pleasing

I began this project by writing this readme on April 17, 2017. I hope for this repository to be home to a complete website by April 24, 2017. Once I have a solid page, I will use Github Pages to host this website and post the link on my social media pages in hopes of getting feedback (positive and suggestions for improvement).

I will update this readme as I progress in this project.
